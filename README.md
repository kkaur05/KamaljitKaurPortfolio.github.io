Senior Year Project 2022-2023

Hi, I'm Kamaljit, I'm interested in coding and learning more about computers. I also want to learn other programming languages that I haven't learned. I'm currently learning about jQuery and JavaScript. I'm looking to collaborate on projects that will help me to increase my knowledge on program languages. I can be reached at kkau0017@taehs.org or kamaljitk@nycstudents.net
